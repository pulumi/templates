  full: |
    The AWS Static Website template deploys an HTML-based website on AWS with Pulumi.
    It uses an Amazon S3 bucket for file storage, configures the bucket to host a
    website, and deploys an Amazon CloudFront Distribution to serve the website with
    low latency, caching, and HTTPS. The template generates a complete Pulumi program,
    including placeholder web content, to give you a working project out of the box
    that you can customize easily and extend to suit your needs.
