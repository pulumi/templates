    The Azure Static Website template makes it easy to deploy a static website on Azure
    with Pulumi, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure CDN.
  full: |
    The Azure Static Website template deploys an HTML website on Microsoft Azure. It uses
    an Azure Blob Storage account for file storage, configures the storage account to host
    a website, and deploys an Azure CDN Endpoint to serve the website with low latency,
    caching, and HTTPS. The template generates a complete Pulumi program, including
    placeholder web content, to give you a working project out of the box that you can
    customize easily and extend to suit your needs.
