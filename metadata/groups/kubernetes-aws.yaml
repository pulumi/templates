    Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on AWS with Pulumi and Amazon EKS.
  meta: |
    The AWS Kubernetes template makes it easy to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on AWS with Pulumi and Amazon EKS.
  full: |
    The AWS Kubernetes Cluster template creates an infrastructure as code project in your
    favorite language and deploys a managed Kubernetes cluster to AWS. The architecture
    includes a VPC with public and private subnets and deploys an Amazon EKS cluster that
    provides a managed Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes worker nodes are deployed on
    private subnets for improved security. Load balancers created by workloads deployed on
    the EKS cluster will be automatically created in the public subnets. The template
    generates a complete infrastructure as code program to give you a working project out
    of the box that you can customize easily and extend to suit your needs.
