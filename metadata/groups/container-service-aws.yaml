    Deploy a container service on AWS with Pulumi and Amazon ECS.
  meta: |
    The Container Service template makes it easy to deploy a container service on AWS with
    Pulumi and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).
  full: |
    The Container Service template creates an infrastructure as code project in your
    favorite language that deploys a container service to AWS. You can then use the
    container service to build your own containerized application. The architecture
    includes Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) for cluster management, AWS Fargate to
    run the cluster on serverless compute, and an Application Load Balancer that serves
    the container endpoint to the internet. It also uses an Amazon Elastic Container
    Repository (ECR) that stores the container image. The template generates a complete
    Pulumi program that provisions the cloud resources and installs Nginx in a container,
    providing you with a working project out of the box that you can customize easily and
    extend to suit your needs.
