  full: |
    The Google Cloud Static Website template deploys an HTML website on Google Cloud
    Platform. It uses a Cloud Storage bucket for file storage, configures the storage
    account to host a website, and provisions a Global Address to route traffic to the CDN
    for lower latency and caching. The template generates a complete Pulumi program,
    including placeholder web content, to give you a working project out of the box that
    you can customize easily and extend to suit your needs.
