 # Azure Native Python Pulumi Template

 A minimal Pulumi template for provisioning an Azure Resource Group and a Storage Account using the Azure Native provider with Python.

 ## Overview

 This template demonstrates:

 - Provider: `pulumi-azure-native`
 - Resources:
   - `azure-native:resources:ResourceGroup` — a new resource group
   - `azure-native:storage:StorageAccount` — a storage account in the resource group
 - Output:
   - `primary_storage_key` — the primary key of the storage account

 Use this template as a starting point to learn Pulumi, author infrastructure-as-code in Python, and build on top of basic Azure resources.

 ## Prerequisites

 - An Azure subscription with sufficient permissions
 - Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
 - Python 3.7 or later

 ## Usage

 1. Create a new project from this template:

    ```bash
    pulumi new azure-python
    ```

 2. When prompted, enter your project name, description, and Azure location. The default `azure-native:location` is `WestUS2`.

 3. Deploy the stack:

    ```bash
    pulumi up
    ```

 ## Project Layout

 ```plaintext
 .
 ├── __main__.py        # Pulumi program defining your infrastructure
 ├── Pulumi.yaml        # Project settings and template metadata
 └── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies (Pulumi SDK and provider)
 ```

 ## Configuration

 This template exposes the following configuration variable:

 - `azure-native:location` — Azure region to deploy resources. Defaults to `WestUS2`.

 Set or override it with:

 ```bash
 pulumi config set azure-native:location eastus
 ```

 ## Outputs

 After deployment, the following output is available:

 - `primary_storage_key` — the primary access key for the storage account

 Retrieve it with:

 ```bash
 pulumi stack output primary_storage_key
 ```

 ## When to Use This Template

 - You want a quick Azure infrastructure starter with Pulumi and Python
 - You're learning infrastructure-as-code patterns on Azure
 - You need a simple storage account setup to build applications

 ## Next Steps

 - Customize resource names and add more Azure services (e.g., Virtual Networks, Key Vault)
 - Explore the `pulumi-azure-native` documentation for available services
 - Migrate this template into a larger multi-stack setup
